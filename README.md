# Jumbo-Hack-Project-

The Project: Include your team name, and 2 to 3 sentences describing the goal of your project. What were your goals, and what did you accomplish over the weekend?

Team Name: CodeQuest
The Team: Anubhav Sinha, AJ Romeo, Grant Caile, Carlos Schober
Goal:

    Our team saught to provide a new approach to learning new coding languages, based around how schools teach spoken languages. We created a website to encourage and guide the user through their journey to learning a new language using a known one as reference. Our website supports 6 popular programming languages, offers 35 problems of increasing difficulty, and offers all the built in tools to write and run code to improve as a programmer!

APIs used:
-Vercel: Google Authentication
-SupaBase: User data base
-Judge0: Runs user's code
-Claude: Generate starter and reference code for questions
-Monaco Editor: Code editor interface

Front end:
-Vercel: Deployment
-React

Back end:
-SupaBase

    Claud: Assisting building the UI

Optional Reflection: Because we love learning, tell us about what you learned this weekend!

What motivated your team to choose this project? Are there bigger ideas or features for the project that you’d want to implement in the future?

    As programmers we understand that learning a new coding language is very similar to learning a new spoken language. However, whereas most institutions teach second languages using the student's first for reference, programming languages are more often than not taught in a vaccume. We wanted to present a new way to learn coding languages that matched the tested and trained methods of teaching spoken ones.

    In the future, we would like to improve the website's capabilities to guide the user's journey, as well as implement more unique languages.

Tell us about a tricky bug, a design challenge, or that you encountered. How did your team tackle it together?

    We spent a lot of time deciding the structure and design of our home page. We wanted a UI that was very clear, orgnaized, and user friendly, and after a lot of time and tweeking we produced a design we're proud to present!

Tell us about one fun or interesting experience that you had with other hackers! Did you get coffee with new friends? Did you attend a workshop that inspired you? Did you meet someone new?

    Our team took the opportunity to eat every lunch, dinner, and breakfast together. In the process we got to learn about each of our interests, skills and hobbies, and worst of all that Anubhav knows how to code in Basic!
